# Transit accessibility analyzer and comparator
1. Step 1. upload and process raw GTFS data
2. Basic viewers (for 'facilities' routes, stations, lines, etc.)
    Left: table (list of stations/routes); select time; Right: map
    Bottom: histograms (changes over time)
    (1) Plot distribution of stations
    (2) For each route, generate stations with time table involved.
3. Grid analysis (generate network grids)
    (1) For each selected grid, the number of bus visits the grid over time
    (2) Given the starting grid, accessibility from the grid to other grids

    Unlike traffic network, the edges are links are changing over time of the day.
    Thus, the spatio-temporal network is necessary for shortest paths analysis. For the problem below:
    - There are three routes (i.e., Route A, Route B, and Route C) in the transit system
    - Each route has a bus traveling back and force along the route
    - Thus, the spatio-temporal network can be drawn (see the 3-dimensional Figure on the right)
    - The grey vertical edges on the right Figure denote the choice of passengers waiting at the same bus stop
